# Tunneld

Tunneld is a simple tunneling tool that allows you to expose your local services to the internet,
but it's **mainly designed for 🌟testing and ✨development purposes**.

It resolves the problem of let your k8s inside traffic to reach your local services, the great
advantage of this idea is that you can mocking any external service in your `_test` file, no matter
which language you are using.
